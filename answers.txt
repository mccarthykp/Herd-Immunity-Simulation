1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation?
  Population Size: 100,000
  Number Vaccinated: 25,000
  Virus Name: Ebola
  Mortality Rate: 0.70
  Reproductive Rate: 0.90

2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
  By the third step of the Ebola Virus Simulation, 74.99% of the population had been infected. 

3. What percentage of the population died from the virus?
  52.49% of the population died as a result of the Ebola Virus. 

4. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?
  There were 7,909,173 interactions where being vaccinated saved the individual from becoming infected.
